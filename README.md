# Combined example : Reactive encapsulated state in composable with Veevalidate + Zod Form Validation

## VeeValidate with Zod

Main points:

- best UX for forms : scrollTo, Error Message, Disabled, Native HTML Errors
- schema validation at the same place, errormessages at the same place

Additional Points:

- native Form, label and input binding

## reactive functional state

State linked to a model : User

Basic CRUD :

- show in UsersLists
- select a row in UsersList to update
- create a new one from scratch
- delete from list or modal
